    <h1>Ron Swanson</h1>
    <p>Ronald Ulysses Swanson is a fictional character portrayed by Nick Offerman from the situation comedy television
        series Parks and Recreation on NBC, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. In the series, Ron is the
        director of the Parks and Recreation department of fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana, and the immediate superior
        of series protagonist Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). In demeanor, political philosophy and work ethic, Knope and
        Swanson are polar opposites: where Knope is sunny and outgoing, decidedly liberal and constantly working,
        Swanson is distant, and as a staunch libertarian, is a strong advocate for small government—stating his belief
        that government should be privatized—and therefore believes that the parks department should not even exist.</p>
    <p>Ron, who has an extremely deadpan and stereotypical masculine personality, actively works to make government less
        effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, Lagavulin whisky,[2]
        breakfast foods, nautical literature, and sex. He hates and fears his ex-wives, both named Tammy, one of whom is
        played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of
        those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues and has a particularly strong respect for
        Leslie.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Despite Ron being a very private person, including getting his birthdate redacted from all public
        documents, his background does occasionally come up. He was born in a small town to Tamara "Tammy"
        Swanson and a father unnamed in the series. He grew up on a farm in a small town and is shown to have
        enjoyed woodworking from an early age, building his first chair at age 5. Ron is opposed to child labor
        laws, stating he got his first job at a sheet metal factory at age 9 and, in two weeks, was running the
        floor. Ron says that at age 11, he was offered a higher paying job at the tannery and attempted to do
        both jobs while going to middle school before realizing it would be better to only work at the sheet
        metal factory saying, “don’t half-ass two things - whole-ass one thing." Ron claimed that, at age 12, he
        went to prom and was working at a quarry. When he was 15, Ron moved in with his first wife, Tammy One,
        who was a candy striper at the hospital when he was born, and subsequently both his math and Sunday
        school teacher; he has said that although the circumstances of their relationship were considered
        scandalous, people were too afraid of her to say anything. Ron said that when he was 18, his father
        wanted him to work at the steel mill, but he chose to go to college instead.</p>

    <h2>Storyline</h2>
    <h3>Season 1</h3>
    <p>Ron Swanson made his first appearance in the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation, where he repeatedly denies
        Leslie's requests to pursue turning a construction pit into a park because he does not believe the parks
        department should build parks at all. He agrees to green-light the project only when city planner Mark
        Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider) secretly cashes in an unspecified favor in exchange for the approval (Later, in
        the episode Practice Date, it could be assumed that Mark already knew about Ron's alter ego since he told Tom to
        visit an Eagleton Club where Tom could see Duke Silver. We can assume that the favor Mark uses, was in return to
        keep Ron's alter ego a secret.)[62] In a deleted scene from the episode "Canvassing", Ron tries to leave
        government employment for a previously offered job at an Internet flower company. However, when he finds that
        business is now doing extremely poorly, Ron sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time.[63]
        In the episode "Boys' Club", Ron attends a disciplinary hearing with Leslie after she gets in trouble when the
        underage April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) is seen drinking alcohol on a video on the Pawnee website. Ron interrupts
        half-way through the review, defends Leslie and angrily berates the panel for aggressively questioning her.
        Although Ron claims he did it only due to his hatred for bureaucratic procedures, it is implied that he really
        did so out of respect for Leslie.</p>
    <h3>Season 2</h3>
    <p>In "Practice Date," when the parks department employees hold a contest to find who can learn the biggest secrets
        about each other, Ron discovers Tom's marriage to the attractive surgeon Wendy (Jama Williamson) is actually a
        green card marriage. Ron promises he will keep Tom's arrangement a secret. Later, Tom discovers Ron playing the
        saxophone at a bar in his Duke Silver persona. Tom agrees to keep Ron's secret as well.[59][60] Later in the
        season, when Tom's divorce with Wendy is finalized in "Tom's Divorce," Ron politely asks whether Tom would mind
        if he asked Wendy out himself, and explains, "Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size
        for me." Tom outwardly claims to be fine with it but, unbeknownst to Ron, is secretly upset because he actually
        harbors real romantic feelings for Wendy.</p>
    <h3>Season 3</h3>
    <p>The third season opens with Ron seen begrudgingly returning to his city hall job after the Pawnee government has
        been shut down for three months.[74] Ron starts to become a father figure of sorts to April and Andy (Chris
        Pratt) during the third season, despite his insistence that "I'm not interested in caring about people."[29][75]
        When April is hospitalized with influenza in "Flu Season," she starts to explain her relationship problems with
        Andy, but Ron insists he does not want to know about her private affairs. However, after Ron hires Andy to be
        her temporary replacement, the two spend the day bonding and Ron, against his better judgment, tells Andy that
        April is in the hospital and that he should visit her.[29][31][76] Later in the season, in "Media Blitz," Ron
        gets even further involved by chastising April for leading Andy on, and urges her to either forgive Andy or move
        on. His advice ultimately helps April decide to forgive Andy.</p>
    <h3>Season 4</h3>
    <p>In "I'm Leslie Knope," Ron grabs an emergency survival bag and flees to live in the wilderness after learning
        that his first ex-wife Tammy 1 (Patricia Clarkson) has arrived in town. When Leslie's campaign managers decide
        to announce her candidacy for city council sooner than expected, she panics and also flees to the wilderness to
        hide out with Ron. Together they realize they cannot run from their problems and they both return to the parks
        department. Tammy 1, who is an IRS agent, later meets up with Ron in his office and serves him audit papers.</p>
    <h3>Season 5</h3>
    <p>In "How a Bill becomes a Law," Ron meets Diane Lewis (Lucy Lawless) who had been ignored when asking about
        filling in a pothole. Ron becomes a friend of hers and, in "Halloween Surprise," he takes her two daughters out
        trick-or-treating and they begin dating. In "Women in Garbage," while babysitting Diane's daughters, he admits
        to Ann he loves Diane. Later in the episode, she admits she also loves him. In the fifth-season finale "Are You
        Better Off?," Andy is talking to Ron about a pregnancy test he found when Diane comes in and says she needs to
        talk to him, leaving the question if she is pregnant in a cliffhanger.</p>
    <h3>Season 6</h3>
    <p>In the sixth-season premiere "London," Diane reveals that she is pregnant. Ron proposes, and she accepts on the
        condition they not have a huge wedding. They immediately get married on the fourth floor before he joins Leslie
        on a trip to London, which he despises, and the Lagavulin distillery in Scotland, which he heartily enjoys.
        Later in the season, Ron and Diane have a son, whom they name Jon. During The Unity Concert in the season
        finale, Ron reveals himself as Duke Silver to the public when he takes the stage with Mouse Rat.</p>
    <h3>Season 7</h3>
    <p>Three years after Season 6, at the start of Season 7 in 2017, Leslie and Ron's relationship ("work-place
        proximity associates," as Ron calls his friends) has collapsed into one of complete animosity. Both have left
        the Parks Department—Ron has started his own construction company, while Leslie works for the National Parks
        Service—and are competing in a bidding war for a piece of land in Pawnee owned by the Newport family: Leslie
        wishes to turn it into a national park, while Ron's company has partnered with GRYZZL to turn it into a new
        corporate campus. Despite a brief truce to rescue Councilman Jamm from the clutches of Ron's ex-wife Tammy II,
        their relationship continues to deteriorate, until it reaches its nadir after a pair of press conferences to
        publicize their respective proposals. Leslie and Ron bitterly hurl insults at one another, prompting Ben and the
        rest of their teams to lock them in the Pawnee Parks Department overnight, refusing to let them out until they
        reconcile. After much prying, Leslie learns the real story from Ron's side: After she took Jerry and April to
        work with her, and Tom and Donna left to run their businesses, Ron didn't recognize anyone he worked with
        anymore. This prompted him to make the unthinkable decision to ask Leslie for a job in the federal government,
        so he could work with people he knew again. However, Leslie unknowingly stood him up for lunch due to her new
        hectic life, which he felt was the "punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written." So, Ron left
        the Parks Department to begin his construction company. He and Leslie are eventually able to settle their
        differences and rekindle their friendship.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Ron Swanson was created by Parks and Recreation creators Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, although Nick Offerman
        himself had some input into the character's creation.[9][10] Offerman said in July 2012 that "NBC really
        resisted giving me this part. It took five months for me from the time Mike Schur and Greg Daniels said they
        wanted me to play this part. NBC insisted on auditioning every other guy in the country, and then they finally
        acquiesced."[90] The character's traits were partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official that
        Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur encountered in Burbank while researching for the show, who favored
        as little government interference as possible and admitted, "I don't really believe in the mission of my job...
        I'm aware of the irony."[3][4] Ron is also partially inspired by political appointees of President George W.
        Bush who were perceived to be opposed to the branch of government they were overseeing.[4] Ron's signature
        mustache was one of the first ideas conceived for the character.[9][10] Offerman said the deadpan style of humor
        he uses for Ron Swanson was cultivated during his youth, when he was an altar boy: "I would read things with the
        utmost sincerity, and my cousin would be cracking up because he knew I was full of shit."</p>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>The character of Ron Swanson received universal acclaim; he developed a cult following and is widely considered
        the show's breakout character.[9][93][94][95] Joel Keller of TV Squad called Ron "one of the more inspired
        sitcom characters of the last decade,"[37] Zap2it writer Joel Keller called him one of the best sitcom
        characters since Cosmo Kramer of Seinfeld,[96] and Geoff Berkshire of Variety said that the character would "go
        down in TV history as one of the all-time comedy greats."[97] Gabriel Perna of International Business Times
        wrote, "Offerman's Ron Swanson is one of the main reasons to watch Parks and Recreation. Considering how funny
        the show is and the scope of its cast, that says a lot."[98] Likewise, Gail Pennington, television critic with
        the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, called Nick Offerman "the funniest guy on TV,"[99] and TV Fanatic writer Eric
        Hochberger said, "There's [a] certain character I watch this show for: Ron Swanson."[100] Jonah Weiner of
        Slate.com said Ron "has regularly stolen his scenes" and that Offerman has "a gift for understated physical
        comedy,"[55] and Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said Offerman was not only funny, but capable of expressing a
        surprising range of emotions.</p>
